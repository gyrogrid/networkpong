# networkpong

Welcome to the worst network game in the world. This game is unplayable because of latency but if you still want to play it, please download a client.py file and inform me.
I will start the game on the server and we can then play network pong!

The game requires two python libraries, please install them before attempting to play:
1) PyGame
2) RPyC
